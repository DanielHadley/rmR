# rmR
The text file without an ending is placed in /etc/cron.d/ and set to UTC time (est + 4 hours). It automates the .sh file, which itself triggers the .R script.

My plan from here:

+ Download data each night
+ Daily report
+ Turn weekly maps into monthly or less
+ Get the rest of the cities
+ K-means cluster, see % increase, and do "hottest new hoods" 
+ Replace rat stats
+ find a way to archive posts
+ About me - maybe with I fought
+ Top posts

Maybe

+ sparklines
+ Forecase
